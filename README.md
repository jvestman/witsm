# WitSM - Witty IT Service Management
One page apps for facilitating IT service management operations

## 🚦 How to Use

Each WitSM form provides **three built-in ways** to save, share, or transmit its contents.

### 1. 🔽 Save by downloading a new copy of the form  
Every form can **save itself** — including the data entered — by generating a downloadable HTML file.  
This creates a self-contained snapshot that can be:

- Placed on a shared drive  
- Attached to an email  
- Archived for documentation  
- Re-opened later with all fields preserved
- Used as a template  

The saved file is still fully functional.

### 2. 🔗 Share using a URL fragment  
A form can generate a **URL fragment** (the part after `#` in a URL) containing the user’s input.  
This makes it extremely easy to share structured information:

- Send the link in email, chat, or tickets  
- Open the link to instantly repopulate the form with the encoded data  
- No server required — all parsing is client-side  

This supports simple, infrastructure-agnostic collaboration.

### 3. ✉️ Generate an email (mailto or .eml)  
Forms can also create a ready-to-send email:

- Launch your mail client via a `mailto:` link containing the structured content  
- **Or** generate a `.eml` file that can be opened in any mail program and sent  

This makes WitSM forms directly compatible with standard email-based ITSM workflows.

---

These three methods enable teams to use WitSM with nothing more than the tools they already rely on: email, chat, shared drives, and generic ticketing systems.

## 🎯 Why WitSM?
